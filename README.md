Hi, I'm Ivan. Last year, I graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science and decided to start my career path by learning Frontend development. Recently, I successfully completed a 24-week Frontend course at [Jagaad Academy](https://academy.jagaad.com/). Last six months, I have had a great chance to learn and practice a large number of modern technologies that are needed and useful for Frontend Developer beginners:
* HTML
* CSS
* SASS
* JavaScript / TypeScript
* React / Vue
* Redux 
* Next.js / Nuxt .js
* Docker


In this GitHub profile, you will find some of my projects that cover important topics during the course.
